## Cloth simulation

### Features
- A 3D cloth simulation that supports one-way interaction with a spherical object (earth). 
- A natural camera that allows the user to navigate around the scene using Minecraft creative mode style flying controls
  - shift/space => move down and up
  - WASD => move forward/backwards, left/right
  - mouse => move camera orientation
- High quality rendering, using an earth sphere texture, a Goldy the Gopher cloth texture, and directional 3D lighting
- User interaction: users can move the spherical object (earth) via mouse dragging
- Ripping/tearing: the spherical object can occasionally cause tears in the cloth!
